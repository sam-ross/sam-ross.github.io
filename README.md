# QLab Summer Internship

These are the projects worked on as part of an internship with QLab over Summer 2020 (May-September). I worked on two different projects, as explained below.
<br /><br />

## 1) OpenJSCAD-Threejs 

The main project I worked on was the OpenJSCAD-Threejs project. The high level goal was to create a parameterisable function that outputs a robot arm that QLab can manufacture and simulate.
<br /><br />This project involved taking OpenJSCAD and Threejs and implementing a way to export OpenJSCAD CAD models into the Threejs/Ammojs physics engine, with working collision shapes and constraints etc.
<br /><br />This project is still in working progress, hence the weirdly behaving hinges in the [demo](https://sam-ross.github.io/OpenJSCAD-Threejs/templates/index.html).

<br />


## 2) Threejs-URDF-Loader 

The other, shorter project I worked on was the Threejs-URDF-Loader and it involved taking an [already existing URDFLoader](https://github.com/gkjohnson/urdf-loaders) and converting it from using nodejs/npm modules to using only pure JavaScript ES6 modules.
<br /><br />
The AR2 model in the [demo](https://sam-ross.github.io/Threejs-URDF-Loader/templates/index.html) is not for commercial use.
